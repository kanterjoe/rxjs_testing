#![][rxlogo] ReactiveX JS Testing 


I recently found the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) paradigm, and liked it's style. 

[ReactiveX GitHub](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)

[ReactiveX website](http://reactivex.io/) 


This repository contains some toy apps I have written to play around with it.

## ObserverStream Object

- AJAXObserverStream.js

This has some classes that allow for easier access and setup of Observer streams. They essentially wrap the Observer object and perform all the setup and teardown.


## City Search

- city_search.html
- city_search.js

The city search app is a simple example of using ReactiveX to mix DOM events and AJAX calls in a simple and functionally seperated manner

To use, open the HTML in the browser and enter a City name. Press enter and see the result pop up. Try finding a city where it is currently Hot out!
